Python Scanner class for scanning (lexical analysis of) strings.

The class is styled after Ruby's StringScanner, but is not 100% the same.

For usage, see docs/scanner.html which contains HTML API docs, or use PyDoc.

For non-trivial examples, see in the examples/ directory:
  json.py - a full (but error-intolerant) JSON parser using the obvious 
    recursive descent approach. Scanner is used to power the 'does this match?'
    bits, but this is a non-trivial program in itself.
  javascript.py - A simple JavaScript tokenizer using Scanner. Its relation to 
    Scanner is very close (very little is done except using Scanner's methods), 
    so this is a good one to look at first.
