# Scanner #

Python Scanner class for scanning (i.e. lexical analysis of) strings. The class
is styled after Ruby's StringScanner, but is not 100% the same. For usage, 
see docs/scanner.html which contains HTML API docs, or use PyDoc.

## Examples ##
### Simple ###
Parsing a simple date format:

    scanner = Scanner('09/3/2011 12:15:45')
    day = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '09'
    scanner.get() #   -> /
    month = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '3'
    scanner.get() # -> /
    year = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '2011'
    scanner.scan(r'\s+') # -> ' '

    hour = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '12'
    scanner.get() #   -> :
    minute = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '15'
    scanner.get() # -> :
    second = scanner.scan(r'\d+') # -> '45'

    print (day, month, year, hour, minute, second) # -> ('09', '3', '2011', '12', '15', '45')


For non-trivial examples, see in the examples/ directory:

  * json.py - a full (but error-intolerant) JSON parser using the obvious 
    recursive descent approach. Scanner is used to power the 'does this match?'
    bits, but this is a non-trivial program in itself.
  * javascript.py - A simple JavaScript tokenizer using Scanner. Its relation to 
    Scanner is very close (very little is done except using Scanner's methods), 
    so this is a good one to look at first.
